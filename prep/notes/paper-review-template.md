# Systematic Fuzz Testing Techniques on a Nanosatellite Flight Software for Agile Mission Development

## First Pass
Read title, abstract, introduction, headings
### Category
- What type of paper is this? an experiment, analysis of previous studies, new methodology or something else?

The paper is an application of a new technique (fuzz testing) to the domain of new space flight software

### Context
- What papers is it related to? What were the theoretical bases that were used to analyse the problem?

The paper is related to other papers looking to apply new software methodolgies to the development of mission critical flight software in the new space context. Where software must be portable, fast and cheap to develop, while also being correct.

### Correctness
- Are the assumptions valid?
Based on the introduction, many of the assumptions about flight software are valid.

### Contributions
- How does the paper contribute to the existing scientific understanding?

Preset a methodology developed to apply fuzz tesing to cubesat flight software.

Highlight and discuss the challenges and requirements for doing so.

Present a case study for applying modern testing techniques to critical embedded software.

### Clarity
- is the paper well written and easy to understand?
Yes

### Thoughts

## Second Pass

### What does it do?
#### Rationale
- What is the justification and motivation for the work?
#### Aims
- What does the paper set out to achieve
#### Hypothesis
- What were they testing? What were they expecting to find?

### How does it do it?
#### Participants
- Who? How many? How were they recruited? Why were they selected?
#### Methods
- Research approach? Qualitative/Quantitative? Presenting new method? Reusing existing method?

### What did it find?
#### Findings
- What are the main results?
#### Implications
- Design Implications, scientific implications
#### Falsifiable
- Is it possible to disprove the findings?
#### Limitations
- What factors might have affected the findings? Why might the results be biased?

## Third Pass
Understand the paper in depth, virtually reimplement the paper.

When virtually reimplementing the paper, consider how your implementation would differ to the original
### Weaknesses
#### Pinpoint implicit assumptions
- What assumptions have they made that might not hold true?
#### Experimental/analytical assumptions
- Anything in the analysis or design that could have introduced errors into the findings?
#### Missing citations
- Have they ignored other work that contradicts their findings?

### Strengths
#### Presentation technique
- How did they present and structure their findings and discussion?
#### Support for conclusions
- Do the conclusions they reach match the results that they got?
- Are they making claims that aren't supported by the results?
#### Internal efficacy
- Did they actually achieve what they set out to do?
