# Research Ideas

## Areas
### Embedded Software
I want my project to have some relationship with embedded software as a domain.
I want to expand my skills in embedded software to further my career, and
because I am interested in it.

- RTOS, Active Object
- Rust in Embedded?
- Applying modern techniques to embedded software
    - Fuzz testing
    - Emulation
    - Event Driven programming/active objects
- System modelling
- Executable Specification (BDD, Alloy?)
    - Can you generate tests in python from BDD spec, and link the C code into python to test it?
- Embedded Software Architecture?
- Functional Programming paradigm in Embedded? (e.g. through chicken scheme etc?)


### Space Industry
I would like my project to be relevent to the space industry, to help me
develop my career and niche within that industry.

e.g.
- ISL (distributed systems)
- Spacecraft hardware emulation
- Improving development process for satellites
- Digital twins of satellites?

### Operating Systems / Networks?

- FPGA acceleration of ML models
- Runtime configurable hardware/accelerators?
- Inter Satellite Links, Networks
- Real Time Systems
- Forth Operating System? (Dusk/Collapse OS?)


## Methods

### Case-Study
I like the idea of completing an example project to demonstrate some technology
in a specific domain.

### Resolving a problem with a novel solution


### Applying a well understood technology to a new domain


## Things I want to include
Longer term implications of project choice, or things you want to learn.

### Writing Code
I would like to solve a problem by writing code. I at least want to model a situation, or develop a prototype.
I don't mind if the problem is solved in C/Python and allows me to develop my skills in those, or if the project is using some language that is new to me (Rust, Zig, Lisp, Forth)

### Tooling?
I am interested in the tooling used to develop and verify software, be it
testing, RTOS, proof, code generation, emulation, compilers, simulators, CI/CD etc.

I want to be able to apply something I work on to my work, and I want to have a
tangible artifact as a result of my disertation project. For example, some open
source tool that I can use/continue to develop, or have gained some skill that
will help me with my career, such as DSP, FPGA, Networking, RTOS etc.

### Hard problems
Operating systems, Real time constraints

## Things I want to avoid
### Too much Academia
I don't particularly want to complete a project that doesn't have an immediate use, such as a theoretical project, or a literature survey/review

### LLM's / AI
I'm not particularly interested in researching ML topics.

### Users
I don't really want to be doing questionnaires, thinking about people related
requirements, ethics, human factors, or any other "soft" aspects of computer
science.
I am much more interested in how computers operate and interact with each
other, compared to how people interact with computers.
Specifically, I don't want to my project to involve non-technical users. I
would be quite happy developing software that technical users (e.g. satellite
operators, software engineers, musicians) interact with.
