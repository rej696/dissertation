## Project Proposal
### Areas of focus
#### Software engineering
- Developing a system, with some novel aspect
- Include all activies, such as requirements, spec, design, implementation, testing
#### Research
- Significant background research, may include some software product
#### Experimental
- investigation and evaluation of some new tech.
- describe theoretical foundation of tech, description of the implementation, and the procedures used, and an assesement of the relationship between the project and other published work
#### Theoretical
- Introduce relevent concepts with examples, testing conjectures and developing theorems.

### Proposal Components
Must consider
- Significance of the problem being addressed
- The analysis structure and scope of the project
- Conducted suitable background research on the project
- Created a plan that considers the resource and time demands

Project proposal will be 5 to 10 pages, and consist of the following
#### Problem
- Description of the problem being addressed
- Description will apply early background reading and consideration of time, skilll etc to scope the idea.
#### Background work
- Expose previous work completed and identify how the project will expand on that work
#### Objectives and Research Question
- identify the main objectives and research question for the project.

### Dawson (2015) Notes
Originality:
- Tools, techniques, procedures and methods:
    - Apply new tools and techniques to existing problems
    - Try methods in new contexts
- Exploring the unknown
- Exploring the unanticipated

Contribution refers to new knowledge that is not known, not areas that are new to you.

Knowledge can be understood in terms of data, information, knowledge and wisdom:
- Data is factual elements that describe objects/events
- Information is processed data that has some insight into their meaning, the What?
- Knowlege is higher level understanding, the Why? An interpretation of what you gain from information (e.g. patterns)
- Wisdom represents your ability to put knowledge into practice. i.e. apply skills and experiences to adapt.
- Theory represents ideas and opinions based on observations. i.e. not necessarily true.

Research is a considered activity which aims to make an original contribution to knowledge.

- What am I looking for?
    - Better tooling for embedded software development for (new) space systems
- Why am I looking for it?
    - Improve developer experience
    - Reduce bugs and cost of development
    - Improve correctness of software
    - Make life easier for developing complex systems
- How shall I set about it?
    - Case studies
    - Learning existing tools
    - researching methodologies used in other domains
    - apply (sped up) old space techniques to new space
- Where shall I start looking?
    -

Answering these questions:
- Inductive reasoning:
    - start with observations of the world and come to general conclusions about
      it
- deductive reasoning
    - start with knowledge of the world, and predict likely observations within it

Methods of intellectual discovery:
- assume the problem is solved and calculate backwards
- assume a solution is impossible and try to prove why
- random guesses (i.e brainstorming)
- analogy
- inversion (look at things from the opposite angle)
- partition (decompose the problem into manageable parts)

Consider where you are heading with your research before pursuing it.
Think, what use is this to me?

#### Classifying Research
- Field
    - Grouping similar interests/topics together
- Approach
    - research methods, e.g. case study, experiment, survey
- Nature
    - Pure theoretical development
    - Research that reviews and assesses pure theory and evaluates its potential for practical application
    - Applied research that has some practical application or outcome

##### Research Nature:
Pure theory:
- Developing theories to explain things without linking them to practice

Descriptive studies
- reviewing and evaluating existing theory and knowledge in a field

Exploratory studies
- exploring a situation or problem
- what is happening, seeking new insights, assess phenomena in a new light
- literature searches, questionnaires, interviews
- formulate a previously undefined question

Explanatory studies:
- explaining or clarifying something

Causal Studies:
- assessing the affect that one or more variables have on each other.
- e.g. does the size of software (independent variable) affect how difficult it
  is to maintain (dependent variable)

Resolving a problem with a novel solution
- Problem is predefined/understood, but the means of solving the problem needs to be discovered

Testing out research
- explore the limits of existing theories. seeing if things work under
  different conditions and how they might integrate with new technologies
- applying theories to different areas

#### Good Research
- Open Minds:
    - don't be limited by pre-existing thinking
- Critical analysis:
    - Examine data critically
    - what do the data really mean?
    - how could this be interpreted differently?
- Generalisations
    - generalisation allows work to be applied to a wide variety of situations
    - knowing limits fo generalisations
