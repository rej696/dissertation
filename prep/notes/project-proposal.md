Fuzz Testing Embedded System

- Fuzz Testing a specific system (i.e. FreeRTOS)
    - Emulated Embedded System?
- Fuzz Testing a specific protocol on an Embedded system (i.e. Bluetooth or CAN)
    - CCSDS!!!!
- Investigating techniques for higher coverage such as using Hardware Tracing (Beckmann, 2023)
- Hybrid Static, Dynamic and Fuzzing verification system

## Problem Description
Clearly describe why the problem needs solving

- Security Vunerabilities in IOT or Critical Systems (e.g. Avionics, Satellites)
- Quick and Effective Testing
- Reduce developer overhead?

## Project Objectives
Clearly describe how you plan to solve the problem, and the form it will take

### Research Question
- Define investigation: why did you consider x?
- Set boundaries: why didn't you consider y?
- Provides direction: the type of question determines the method.

e.g. Is the new technique faster to execute than existing techniques when run on system x
- This is good as it provides a _comparison_, a _measure_ and a __context__.

Use the following to review your question
-

## Project Plan
Break the project down into component parts and make sure that each objective will be met

- Investigate available fuzzing technologies
- Develop some reference platform/system
    - Select a micro
    - Build a system that does something (iot, avionics, talk a protocol)
- Build the fuzzing system
