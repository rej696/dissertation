In the past, developing and launching satellites was the domain of large
corporations and governments due to the costs involved. Recently, In order to
take advantage of cheaper access to space (\autoref{sec:motivation}), a new
type of organisation has begun to build and operate space missions.

% TODO introduce characteristics of new space (low earth orbit, cubesats)

\citet{Sweeting_2018} defines New Space as
\begin{quote}
    The emergence of a different ethos for space where the established
    aerospace methods and business have been challenged by more entrepreneurial
    private sector by adopting more agile approaches and exploiting the latest
    commercial-off-the-shelf technologies
\end{quote}

\citet{Denis_2020} describes the current market trends of New Space as
"Darwinism in Space". The creation of new markets in the space environments as
a result of the digital transformation has led to a space industry "gold rush",
with large venture capital investment and a "winner takes all" incentive
driving high levels of competition \citep{Denis_2020}. The impact of this is
that New Space companies must design and manufacture more satellites at a
faster rate and for lower cost if they wish to be competitive.

As a result of the business environment, many New Space start ups have
introduced silicon valley concepts into their businesses, such as "DevOps
culture" and launching Minimum Viable Product (MVP) CubeSats. Furthermore, as
these companies transition from start-ups to mature businesses with an aim to be
profitable, LEAN practices become prevalent, resulting in attempts to reduce
any "wasteful" or expensive practices \citep{Denis_2020}. These market
conditions have led New Space businesses to become more accepting of risk than
their Big Space counterparts \citep{Cratere_2024}

Therefore, Flight Software needs to be developed in shorter time frames and with
lower costs. Satellites in low earth orbit have a shorter lifetime due to
atmospheric drag. CubeSats have a generally high failure rate due to a long
list of possible failure modes which can cripple a platform, with no chance of
repair. Some examples might be a solar panel not deploying, a launch vibration
damaging a critical sensor, or an issue with the thermal management resulting
in the payload having degraded operations. Often, the correctness of the
software systems only becomes an issue when all these barriers have been
passed, and so is a risk that is not considered worth spending time and money
until later in a programme. Thus, new space companies have a vastly different
approach to software systems compared with big space companies, and many of the
approaches used by big space companies to ensure software correctness, such as
extensive system and integration testing and formal methods, are simply to time
consuming and expensive to be applicable in the new space environment.

\section{Satellite Architecture}
% (SPAD book?, Cubesat Handbook)

Software systems are an essential component of modern satellite designs.
Satellites usually include a number of distributed embedded systems, each
tasked with monitoring and controlling different critical subsystems such as
power, attitude control, communication etc. Typically, a satellite will have a
central on board computer (OBC), or command and data handling subsystem (CDH).

There may be a dedicated guidance navigation and control (GNC) or attitude
determination and control (ADCS) subsystem which runs complex algorithms using
data retrieved from sensors like star trackers, rate sensors, magnetometers and
sun sensors to drive actuators like reaction wheels and magnetorquers in order
to point the satellite. Pointing is critical for many tasks. Payload operation
tasks such as imaging require a high degree of accuracy and responsiveness.
Propulsion manoeuvres, managing thermal loads, power generation (i.e. pointing
the solar panels at the sun to improve the efficiency) all require an effective
ADCS subsystem.

The OBC will be connected to many lower power telemetry (TM) nodes, which are
tasked with monitoring temperatures, voltages and currents, and toggling switches
to enable/disable different subsystems. The OBC will log the telemetry reported
by the TM nodes, and if telemetry exceeds limits, handle fault detection,
isolation and recovery (FDIR).

The OBC or CDH subsystem is responsible for handling communication with a
ground station via a radio, and so provides the interface between a satellite
and the operator. This interface is commonly referred to as Telemetry and
Telecommand (TMTC). The operator uses the TMTC interface on the OBC to download data
from orbit, schedule payload operations, and respond to issues.

Payload computers (PLC) are common on satellites with complex payloads and are
responsible for managing and operating whatever instruments are on board for
delivery of the mission, such as radios, imagers, scientific experiments etc.
On smaller satellites, like CubeSats where payloads are less complex, the
responsibilities of the PLC can be handled by the OBC.


\section{Flight Software Development Challenges}

% Discuss Nasa's software development practices, power of ten etc.
% Code Reuse and COTS parts.
CubeSats projects tend to make more use of COTS hardware. However, software that
meets the system requirements often cannot be purchased off the shelf, and so
development costs shift from hardware to software
\citep{Cubesat_Handbook_OBSW}. However, there are several flight software
frameworks, such as NASA's Core Flight System (cFS) \citep{Nasa_cFS}, or Bright
Ascensions Generation One (Gen1) Flight Software Development Kit (FSDK)
\citep{Bal_FSDK}. The main aim of these frameworks is to reduce the cost and
development time for Flight Software through code reuse and hardware
abstraction.

For example, a cFS application uses software abstractions of the operating
system and hardware, called the Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL) and
Platform Support Package (PSP). This allows correctly written application
code to easily be ported between different hardware architectures such as Arm
Cortex-M or SPARC-V8, and different operating systems like FreeRTOS, RTEMS or
Linux \citep{Nasa_cFS}.

The Gen1 FSDK provides libraries of pre-defined configurable software
"Components", which satisfy common Flight Software requirements, such as
logging telemetry. These pre-defined components can be composed together with
bespoke components into a "Deployment" which can be compiled for several
different COTS hardware options, such as the AAC-ClydeSpace Kryten, or the
GomSpace Nanomind \citep{Bal_Options}.

\citet{Farges_2022} evaluates the use of Software Frameworks in the space
industry. They find a number of quality related benefits, such as increasing
reliance on standardised communication interfaces like CCSDS Space Packet
Protocol; as well as cost related benefits attributable to code reuse between
satellite missions. However, they also identify risks with relying on software
frameworks, such as potential issues with licenses, and the limited
adaptability of software that is highly coupled to a framework, as implementing
functions that aren't currently supported in the framework can be difficult.

% FIXME: ( SpaceX's StarLink satellite program is the
% obvious example of this. These satellites have a short mission life of five
% years [REF], )

Developing flight software for satellite systems is a complex process due to
the large number of different interfaces and interdependencies in the
architecture. Furthermore, due to the space environment, computers used in
satellite systems can have stringent environmental requirements, such as high
radiation tolerance to reduce the likelihood of single event upsets (SEU), low
power consumption and consideration of thermal management. The embedded
microcontrollers that meet these requirements can be more expensive than those
commonly used for other applications, like in automotive systems or IOT devices.

Developing software for embedded systems often has a critical dependency on
hardware. Writing drivers for devices using only a datasheet can result in long
periods of rework when hardware is available to test against due to incorrect
information or a misinterpretation. The number of interdependent systems, the
costs of these components, and smaller budgets of new space companies, results
in dedicated engineering hardware required for effective development of
embedded flight software being unavailable. Often engineers are only being able
to test with flight hardware, and then have to fit their testing into a packet
schedule to meet tight deadlines.

% * FIXME should probably talk about protocols?

\section{Fuzz Testing}

% Problem Description from prep report
% FIXME rework to be more about how fuzzing could be a lower cost automated solution to system testing?

% CUT? Reword for space software? security concerns attack surfaces in space?
% Embedded systems are becoming more prevalent in today's society, due to the
% rise of the Internet of Things (IOT) \citep{Abdumohasan_2021}. Embedded
% software is often written in low level languages such as C where errors and
% security vulnerabilities are easy to introduce \citep{Svoboda_2021}, and have
% many many attack surfaces where these mistakes could be exploited
% \citep{Abdumohasan_2021}. Furthermore, many embedded systems have stringent
% reliability requirements, such as safety critical software in automotive
% devices. As such, verification and testing of embedded systems is paramount to
% prevent the presence of security exploits and critical bugs in these devices.
% CUT?

% use information from generic survey papers like Yun_2022, Eisele_et_al_2022 in the introductory section.

Many software programs use a methodology called fuzz testing to automatically
verify software. Fuzz testing is typically used to identify and resolve
security vulnerabilities for programs running on general purpose computers
\citep{Google_2023}. In its most basic form, fuzz testing, or fuzzing, consists
of generating some input test data and monitoring the response of the
software/system under test (SUT) to this input. If the fuzzer detects the
program has crashed, it saves the generated test data for analysis by an
engineer, and mutates the input data in some way to produce a different result.
This brute force approach is known as black-box fuzzing, and given enough time
to execute, will uncover many exploitable bugs with the system, such as memory
leaks, buffer overflows, and off by one errors. Basic black-box fuzzing on an
embedded system will require some fuzzing harness \citep{Eisele_et_al_2022} and
some method of detecting a fault, such as performing a liveness check
\citep{Yun_2022}.

Compared to black-box fuzzing, white-box fuzzing involves targeted test case
generation through static program analysis techniques, generating a test case
to match every statically identified code path. Microsoft have had success
using white-box fuzzing to identify difficult bugs that were missed by
black-box fuzzing \citep{Godefroid_2012}. However, symbolic execution
techniques used in white-box fuzzing can become unfeasably computationally
expensive for larger projects \citep{Krishnamoorthy_2010}.

Grey-box fuzzing is a middle ground between black-box and white-box fuzzing.
Grey-box fuzzing relies on the fuzzer receiving feedback regarding code
coverage for each generated test-case to mutate and generate further test
cases. This approach allows it to find code paths faster than black-box
testing, but without requiring any static code analysis \citep{Yun_2022}.

Grey-box fuzzing of a program can be easily implemented for application (i.e
non-embedded) software using popular fuzzers like AFL. AFL provides a library
that is linked into the program at compile time, along with several sanitisers,
to instrument the program. This allows AFL to receive coverage information from
the running program during fuzzing \citep{AFL_2019}. Embedded systems often run on
constrained environments, where running the fuzzer on the target hardware would
be unfeasible.
% FIXME move this/reword this / find different reference
As such, the fuzzer and the SUT are run in different
environments, and it is difficult to instrument and forward runtime information
for grey-box fuzzing \citep{Muench_2018}.
%

Attempts to solve this problem focus either on fuzzing a program running on
target hardware, or in an emulated environment \citep{Eisele_et_al_2022}.
Running in an emulated environment allows easy inspection of the SUT by the
fuzzer, and potentially faster running and parallel tests
\citep{Eisele_et_al_2022}. However, emulating embedded systems correctly is a
hard problem, and due to the diversity in operating systems, hardware,
peripherals etc. often means that development effort spent on emulating one
system cannot be easily transferred to another.

Yun et al. note that most embedded systems fuzzers rely on emulation
\citep{Yun_2022}. However, most bugs found through emulation still need to be
validated on hardware, and so being able to run the fuzz tests directly on the
target hardware is preferable \citep{Eisele_et_al_2022}.

During the development of an embedded system, engineers often require access to
representative development hardware to effectively design and write software.
Often, waiting for prototype hardware to start software development does not
align with business deadlines. The use of emulators improves enables engineers
to write embedded software without access to development hardware, improving
productivity and reducing development time.

Existing research into embedded systems fuzzing often focuses on its
cybersecurity applications and benefits. However, fuzz testing can also be an
effective method for general verification of software. AdaCore provide a fuzz
testing tool called GNATfuzz, which enables subprogram level fuzz testing as a
supplement to unit testing for Ada and SPARK embedded software
\citep{gnatfuzz}. By isolating subprograms and building isolated fuzz test
executables in a manner similar to a unit testing framework, GNATfuzz removes
the need to be able to run the full program under a fuzzer, and thus the need
for an emulator or target hardware. However, the effectiveness of this approach
is reliant on Ada's extended runtime constraint checking when compared to C
\citep{gnatfuzz}. Furthermore, subprogram level fuzzing is less able detect
more complex issues resulting from interactions with hardware peripherals and
state.

% paragraph on challenges of rehosting? Wright?

While research into the fuzz testing of embedded systems has been increasing
year by year \citep{Yun_2022}, there are few generic solutions
\citep{Eisele_et_al_2022}. The two main challenges to embedded system fuzzing
when compared to desktop or server systems remain the variety in CPU
architectures in embedded systems, and the lack of an operating system such as
linux for bare metal systems \citep{Eisele_et_al_2022}. Currently, the
availability and ease of use of fuzzing tooling for embedded systems does not
match that of desktop applications.
% FIXME this feels like an end, figure out what to do with it.

\citet{IOTFuzzer_2018} implemented IoTFuzzer, an automated black box fuzzing
framework that conduct protocol guided fuzzing on the communication interfaces
of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoTFuzzer performs dynamic analysis on the companion
application to the IoT device to identify the methods for creating valid
communication messages to the device, without needing to reverse engineer the
protocol or access to the binary file loaded on the IoT device. This approach
is effective in identifying vulnerabilities in IoT devices, where firmware is
often not available. However, the tool developed has no real use case in other
classes of embedded devices, such as industrial control systems or safety
critical software, where there is unlikely to be a companion android
application that implements the protocol over the communication interface.
The study does show the effectiveness of using a protocol guided
fuzzer on a communication interface to discover memory errors. Specifically,
they identified the ability to run data generated by the fuzzer through the same
cryptographic functions used in the application to allow the fuzzer to bypass
the barrier of message encryption. Standard fuzzers struggle with common
protocol features, like encryption, authentication, or message validity checks,
because mutating the input data will invalidate a checksum or render a message
unable to be decrypted correctly. [REF]?
% They also identify the use of liveness checks using a heartbeat mechanism to be able to detect crashes.

% Emulation/rehosting story
\citet{Muench_2018} investigated challenges in embedded fuzzing, and reviews
the potential effects of memory corruption bugs on embedded systems.
They identify how to detect different categories of faults through methods such
as liveness tests. They outline different strategies to fuzzing embedded
systems, such as native, partial emulation, and full emulation. Partial
emulation is where the firmware runs in an emulator, and the peripheral devices
are either modelled in some program, or the memory forwarded to the hardware
peripherals. They conducted an experiment to compare different fuzzing
strategies, and found full emulation to be the most successful in detecting
different categories of memory corruption bugs. They also found that fuzzing
against a fully emulated target is significantly faster than fuzzing against a
native device. However, they acknowledge the limited availability of emulators
which include full peripheral emulation, and identify peripheral modelling with
partial emulation as a good compromise between performance and the availability
of both emulators and hardware.
% Muench finds liveness checks to be an unreliable method for detecting all different categories of faults

% talk about other attempts to fuzz test hardware?
\citet{Borsig_2020} investigated different fuzzing techniques for ESP32
microcontrollers, which are commonly used for IoT devices. They carried out
blackbox fuzzing of a simple http server application running on hardware, and
detected crashes by monitoring the serial debug for a fault message. They found
this to be the simplest method for fuzzing an ESP32, but also was very
inefficient for triggering bugs. They also carried out whitebox coverage guided
fuzzing with the HONGGFUZZ coverage guided fuzzer \citep{Honggfuzz}, both on
hardware and using an adapted QEMU emulator. For coverage guided fuzzing on
hardware, the same liveness check was used as blackbox fuzzing. Coverage
information of basic block execution was collected by compiling the binary with
additional instrumentation that could run on hardware and fed to HONGGFUZZ over
a JTAG interface. \citet{Borsig_2020} found that using the coverage guided
fuzzer improved the efficiency of the fuzzing to find bugs, but slowed down the
fuzzing execution when compared to blackbox fuzzing. Given the major drawback
to whitebox fuzzing is the availability of the source code to compile in
instrumentation, they concluded that whitebox on target fuzzing would be an
excellent process for testing ESP32 applications as part of agile development.
When trying to fuzz testing using the modified QEMU emulator,
\citet{Borsig_2020} had difficulty emulating the wifi module integrated into
the ESP32 chip. For whitebox fuzzing, they were able to compile the application
to use an ethernet driver provided by QEMU, rather than the hardware wifi
module. However, for blackbox and greybox fuzzing, they manually located the
code section that handled the wifi driver and manually instructed the fuzzer to
insert input data at that location, fuzzing specific sections of the
application. Overall, they concluded that greybox fuzzing using QEMU would be
an effective tool for security analysts looking to fuzz test specific sections
of ESP32 firmware, such as communication stacks \citep{Borsig_2020}.

\citet{Eisele_2022} aims to investigate on target coverage guided fuzzing. They
proposed using the GNU Debugger (GDB) and hardware breakpoints as an
architecture and source code agnostic method of collecting feedback for a
coverage guided fuzzer. Given the limited number of hardware breakpoints
avaiable on embedded systems, They propose several algorithms for selecting
their location for generating feedback. They present initial results, which
show that even with a small number of breakpoints, all their strategies gain
greater coverage overall compared to blackbox fuzzing. They concede that
emulation based fuzzing is likely to produce better results than their method.
However, they state the aim of debugger driven fuzzing is to make coverage
guided fuzz testing easier to conduct for embedded devices, with an assumption
that setting up and running emulation based coverage guided fuzzing for
embedded systems is too complex.

\citet{Beckmann_2023} proposed an alternative method for on target coverage
guided fuzzing, making use of the tracing facilities on modern Arm Cortex-M
microcontrollers to stream coverage information back to the fuzzer. They use
the Serial Wire Debug interface to periodically sample the value of the Program
Counter (PC) on the target, which they used to generate instruction coverage.
Using this technique alone gave worse fuzzing efficiency compared to a blackbox
fuzzer. The fuzzer generated "false positive" inputs, where because not every
instruction was sampled, some semanitically different inputs could be
considered identical. To combat this, they proposed several improvements. One
was to configure the tracing interface to notify upon entry and exit from an
interrupt handler, during which instruction coverage feedback could be ignored.
However, the most effective modification was to make use of hardware
breakpoints to validate any new coverage identified by the fuzzer. After the
fuzzer identified new coverage, a breakpoint would be set at that instruction,
and the input re-run. If the breakpoint was hit and the target halted, then the
coverage was valid. \citet{Becmann_2023} concluded that their methodology
outperforms on target blackbox fuzzing, providing a reasonable trade-off
between fuzzing speed and effectiveness.

\citet{Maier_2019} developed a tool called UnicoreFuzz for fuzzing operating
system kernel code by running the kernel code using an emulator. Traditional
coverage guided fuzzers rely on feedback mechanisms provided by the kernel, and
using the host operating system as both the fuzzer target and to run the fuzzer
means crashes resulting from fuzz testing would stop the fuzzer.
\citet{kAFL_2017} had previously tried to solve this problem through fuzzing an
operating system kernel running in a separate, virtualised environment, making
use of hardware virtualisation tracing features to gather feedback for the
fuzzer. UnicoreFuzz was built on top of a tool called UnicornAFL
\citep{Maier_2019}. Unicorn is a framework for building emulators, which builds
on top of the instruction set emulation capabilities of QEMU \citep{Unicorn}.
UnicornAFL is a patched version of Unicorn which allows rehosted binaries to be
run under American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), a popular coverage guided fuzzing tool
\citep{UnicornMode, AFL_2019}.
\citet{Maier_2019} focuses on emulating and fuzzing parser code in the kernel,
as parser code usually does not have hardware dependencies, and they
acknowledge modelling hardware peripherals is not an easy task in unicorn.
UnicoreFuzz uses gdb to dump register and memory data at a breakpoint, and then
loads the dumped state into UnicornAFL, allowing the code beginning at the
breakpoint to be fuzzed with the emulator. \citet{Maier_2019} found that while
the performance of UnicoreFuzz was worse than other methods, it was able to
fuzz test any code on any hardware architecture supported by unicorn. Due to
the similarity in constraints between kernel and embedded software, They
posited that porting UnicoreFuzz to embedded operating systems would be viable,
so long as the embedded processor had a debug interface that could export pages
of memory and register values.

UnicoreFuzz was able to fuzz sections of software with no hardware interaction.
However, this ignores the fact that all embedded software programs will have
dependencies on hardware peripherals. However a series of developments have
been made to enable generic rehosting of firmware using the unicorn emulator.

\citet{HALucinator_2020} developed HALucinator, a tool for firmware rehosting
through emulating the hardware abstraction layer. Embedded software typically
relies on a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to interact with hardware
peripherals. For example, to set the value of a GPIO pin on an STM32 chip, you
would call the \lstinline{HAL_GPIO_WritePin} HAL function \citep{stm32hal}.
This function then handles writing the value to the correct memory location
(MMIO) for that chip to set the GPIO, abstracting the hardware specific
implementation from the functionality. HALucinator parses HAL libraries to
provide a high level emulation (HLE) environment on top of QEMU by assigning
abstract peripheral models to HAL functions in the binary
\citep{HALucinator_2020}. This allows firmware to be run on the emulator
interactively, as well as under a fuzzer like AFL. HALucinator has a number of
prerequisites. The firmware needs to make use of a HAL library for all hardware
interaction. The HAL library either needs to already be supported, or the
handler functions for the library need to be implemented. This is a manual
process, but when completed can be reused for any device using that HAL
library. There also needs to be valid peripheral models implemented for all the
HAL functions used. \citet{HALucinator_2020} demonstrated the use of
HALucinator for fuzzing and dynamic analysis using CPUs and HALs from three
different vendors, using it to detect security bugs in firmware samples.

% FIXME move/reword/find different reference
Attempts have been made to automate emulator development, such as Clements et
al. HALucinator, which allows Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) functions in a
compiled binary to be stubbed and fuzzed \citep{Clements_2021}.

% Halucinator has to generate all the hal stubs, what about other embedded libraries that make use of hardware features, like RTOS?
\citet{Clements_2021} extended HALucinator to work with systems that use the
VxWorks real time operating system (RTOS) as a case study. VxWorks is a
commercial RTOS that is used in many safety critical and space applications.
RTOSes often have their own hardware abstractions, and make use of Board
Support Packages (BSP) to adapt the core RTOS code to different hardware.
While \citet{Clements_2021} successfully run three different VxWorks firmwares
on the emulator, the process for doing so was involved, and required extensions
and modifications to the original HALucinator tool. However, they do review
their original process and outline an approach for rehosting other RTOSes with
HALucinator.

\citet{Chen_2022} investigated a novel approach to fuzzing Real Time Operating
Systems (RTOS) which involves slicing a single program into its constituent
tasks and construct a call graph of program based on critical functions such as
external data entrypoints. Each tailored execution tree is was then fuzzed
separately using a UnicornAFL based emulator. The tool is able to detect and
skip "input-irrelevant" function calls as well code that is "emulation-hard",
such as HAL functions. The tool focuses on code paths that handle input data,
so there are minimal side effects from ignoring these functions.

Where SFuzz is only interested in fuzzing a single input to firmware, Fuzzware
is a tool that takes a different approach by considering all memory available
to the firmware as input \citep{Fuzzware_2022}. Fuzzware expands upon
HALucinator, but rather than using the HAL as the boundary for the fuzzer and
the SUT, it models the MMIO, such that each MMIO access uses fuzzer input.
Fuzzware is also based on UnicornAFL, and uses symbolic execution to apply
"access models" to MMIO locations. These access models guide the fuzzer to only
generate meaningful values for memory accesses. For example, in the case where
an MMIO location is only read and compared to a magic number, the symbolic
execution engine will tell Fuzzware to use a "constant" access model for that
MMIO, with the magic number as the constant value. Alternatively, if an MMIO
register is accessed, and only certain bits of the register are used (a common
occurrence when working with embedded software), Fuzzware will use the
"bitfield" access model, and so the fuzzer will only generate input data for
the bits used by the firmware. This massively reduces the "input overhead" of
the fuzzer, i.e. input data that isn't actively used by the firmware during the
fuzz test. \citet{Fuzzware_2022} show that this approach makes the fuzzer much
more effective at discovering coverage than other rehosting-based fuzzing
tools.

AFL traditionally expects the program being fuzzed to require a flat binary input.
While Fuzzware removes a lot of "input overhead", it reinterprets the flat
input from AFL as a series of MMIO accesses, but AFL still only has one input
stream. This can result in the input being hard to mutate effectively, as
changing a bit could result in a different execution path in the program, and
so changing the semantics of later bits in the stream.
Hoedur \citep{Hoedur_2023} is an extension of Fuzzware, which includes a novel
multi-stream fuzzer, rather than AFL, such that each MMIO access consumes input
data from its own input stream. This greatly improves the ability of the fuzzer
to mutate MMIO input data. Unlike HALucinator before them, both Fuzzware and
Hoedur perform automated firmware rehosting, as the only manual work needed to
fuzz a firmware is knowledge and configuration of the firmwares memory map and
architecture. Generating data for MMIO locations means that modelling
peripherals, like HALucinator, is not necessary. However, this means that
unlike HALucinator, firmware run on Hoedur or Fuzzware cannot be run
interactively, it must be run under the fuzzer. While both are based on
Unicorn, which supports multiple target architectures, Fuzzware and Hoedur are
only currently available on ARM Cortex-M, chosen for its popularity, and use in
other state of the art fuzzers to allow fair comparisons. Given Hoedur's
independent input streams for each MMIO, \citet{Hoedur_2023} identified the
integration of specialized grammar fuzzers into Hoedur as an area for future
work. This would further reduce "input overhead" on communication interfaces,
as grammar fuzzers are better able to correctly handle encryption or packet
validation. These are common features of embedded communication protocols, as
demonstrated by IoTFuzzer \citep{IOTFuzzer_2018}.

Fuzztruction \citep{Fuzztruction_2023} moves away from AFL entirely to resolve
these issues surrounding encryption/checksums by creating a new type of fuzzer
that mutates not just the input data, but the generator that generates the
input data, allowing it to adapt to information about protocols contained in
the binaries themselves.

This is not too disimilar to IOTFuzz using the
generators in mobile applications?

\citet{Fuzztruction_2023} using fault injection based fuzzing to leverage implicit domain knowledge? not using grammars, but by finding how the interface works by using the knowledge already encoded in the binaries, by mutating the code that generates the input, rather than

% CUT? TODO reword to remove NRF52 and make generic about embedded fuzzing
The design and implementation of embedded software and its verification is
highly coupled to hardware. The nordic semiconductor NRF52 family of
microcontrollers are a common choice for IOT devices. NRF52s are based on the
ARM Cortex-M architecture, and include embedded radio peripherals, such as
bluetooth low energy and wifi (amongst others). Another common IOT radio
microcontroller is the ESP32, for which Borsig et al. previously developed a
fuzzing framework \citep{Borsig_2020}. Furthermore, Yun suggested the need for
further research into emulation of specific architectures and devices
\citep{Yun_2022}. An NRF52 was used by Beckmann for on-target coverage guided
fuzzing of a bare metal ARM Cortex-M system using instruction tracing over a
single wire output (SWO) interface \citep{Beckmann_2023}. Additionally, Behrang
outlines a method for using the unicorn cpu emulator to execute NRF52 based
bare-metal radio firmware \citep{Behrang_2023}. The desktop fuzzer AFL++
includes an implementation called "unicorn\_mode" which allows the unicorn
engine to be built with AFL++ support \citep{UnicornMode}. Maier develops the
Unicorefuzz framework and presents an example use of AFL++ Unicorn Mode for
fuzzing kernel modules, which have similar challenges to embedded systems
\citep{Maier_2019}.

\section{Fuzz Testing in the Space Industry}
% Introduce the Space Context? (maybe earlier) reference willbold and gutierrez

% ** Flight Software security and protocols
% ...spacepacket, framing, checksums etc? Fuzzware and Hoedur

% Build on Hoedur and Willbold to integrate a protocol fuzzer for spacepacket/ccsds protocols?
% - investigate Hoedur, how does it work, how can it be extended?
% - investigate protocol fuzzers, what do we need to do to build one?
% - test against Willbolds open source satellite software with the protocol fuzzer, and compare results?

% CUT?
% However, while much research outlines the
% challenges with current embedded systems fuzzing techniques, it is unclear how
% these challenges compare with the effort required to verify embedded software
% using traditional techniques. In order to prove that embedded fuzz testing is a
% viable alternative to existing verification methods, a comparison of the cost
% effectiveness of conducting embedded fuzzing with other verification techniques
% is required.
