Discussion

% Review thoughts about fuzzing

% discuss implementation of grammar filter

% blackbox fuzzing with and without grammar filter

% coverage guided fuzzing implementation, explain AFL, show some screen shots.
% - describe the process of integrating and running the fuzzer under unicorn.
%    - input callback, forkserver, etc.
% - difficulty with taking a long time to fuzz?
% - discuss potential improvements such as parallel builds
% - reducing fuzzing area (i.e target specific functions)
% - fuzzing potential more useful for analysis or verification of finished software, rather than software still in development.
% - fuzzing results somewhat invalidated after any changes, which is an issue when there is churn in implementation, and while fuzzing takes 6 days + to get meaningful coverage

% Present Fuzzing Results, show coverage graphs
% tradeoffs between grammar fuzzing and normal data
% - checksum and frameing means more data gets through to application
% - have to inject known errors to get coverage in protocol layer (e.g. invalid headers), reduces the effectiveness of fuzzing for finding bugs/vulnerabilities in this area.
