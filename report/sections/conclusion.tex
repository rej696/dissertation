Conclusions and Future Work

% compare findings back to the research questions identified in the introduction

% Future Work:
% - Implement Spacepacket Grammar Filter for Hoedur
% - Investigate running flight sotfware under Hoedur
% - Investigate speed improvements with fuzzing, native implementations of peripheral models
% - develop configurable peripheral modelling library for cortex-m micros to reduce emulator development burden?
% - Investigate running more complex flight software under unicorn emulator?
% - Have spacepacket responses be parsed and validated by the fuzzer
% - Implement space data link layer for grammar fuzzer, (and/or other protocols?)
% - Integrate grammar filter with normal random afl input, so that both techniques can generate input data? (filter and normal data are not the same structure though?)
