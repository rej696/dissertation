Conclusions and Future Work

% compare findings back to the research questions identified in the introduction

% Future Work:
% - Implement Spacepacket Grammar Filter for Hoedur
% - Investigate running flight sotfware under Hoedur
% - Investigate speed improvements with fuzzing, native implementations of peripheral models
% - develop configurable peripheral modelling library for cortex-m micros to
%   reduce emulator development burden?
% - Investigate running more complex flight software under unicorn emulator?
% - Have spacepacket responses be parsed and validated by the fuzzer
% - Implement space data link layer for grammar fuzzer, (and/or other protocols?)
% - Integrate grammar filter with normal random afl input, so that both
%   techniques can generate input data? (filter and normal data are not the
%   same structure though?)

% - FIXME run without interrupts until rtos_run re-enables interrupts?
%   after this boot process is complete, then we can "tick" using emu start
%   timeouts and handle interrupts inbetween without needing a code callback?
% - could also do WFI in rtos_on_idle, and then detect the call to WFI and skip
%   to the next systick/pendsv interrupt in the emulator to speed up?
% - rtos_schedule triggers pendsv, which is typically executed in the
%   systick interrupt. need to have pendsv trigger after systick has returned
%   (systick higher priority than pendsv) this should happen by default if we run
%   "application" emulator code (non-interrupts) in increments of the systick
%   frequency
