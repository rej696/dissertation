% Acknowledgements

My Parents (Jon and Claire), and my Flatmates (Riccardo and Yingchen) for
encouraging me and helping me sort through difficulties with writing and
managing the demands of both work and university in parallel.

My friends, Kieran, Tom, Sally, Jill, for always supporting my endeavours
through the years.

All of my colleagues at AAC ClydeSpace for giving me time and space and support
to work on my university projects.

James Xie, for always listening to me rant during bouldering sessions, and
always responding with useful actionable advice.

Ben Metcalf, for being a technical sounding board, and always being, or at
least appearing to be, interested when I have shared new things I learned or
demoed aspects of my project.

My previous colleagues from Altran (Capgemini) Claire, Paul, Theo, Beth, Kate,
Anthony, Rowan, Ben; without whom I wouldn't be studying computer science or
have a career in software engineering.

My supervisor, Michael Wright, for reassuring me and helping me shape my
project work into a dissertation.

The Open Source Software community, whose dedicated work has propped up my own.
