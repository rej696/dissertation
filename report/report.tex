\chapter{Introduction}

% [ ] Explanation of developing software in new space
% [ ] Explanation of Emulation and Fuzzing
% [ ] Literature Review of existing Embedded Emulation/Fuzzing Techniques
%      - Fuzzware, Hoedur
%      - Fuzzing Protocols with Fuzzware/Hoedur, introduce grammar filter?
%      - Papers don't emulate/fuzz rtos behaviours?
% [ ] Research Questions and Objective

% RQ1: Analyse the effectiveness of different fuzzing methods for incremental development of flight software
% RQ2: Analyse the impact of using a protocol grammar filter on fuzzer performance, measured in coverage
